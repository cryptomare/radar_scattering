# Interactive plots of radar scattering.

This binder is currently made of two notebooks, one concerning volume scattering and one concerning surface scattering.

In future I intend to add two more: one on the single-layer RT model SSRTR (Ulaby & Long, 2014) and one on the altimetric functionality of SMRT.
